### Contributions Processing

After the process of adding Members and Sponsors to a Scheme, the next step is to upload members contributions. Contributions can be uploaded to the system in two ways: as a single contribution for one member or multiple contributions for more than one member in batch using a template.

## Single Contribution

To make a single contribution, select a member from the list of Members Register and click the **New Single Contribution** link as shown below:

## Single Contribution Approval

For every single contribution uploaded, authentication of the action is needed before the process is committed. This is done by clicking the **Contribution Approval** link to open the Contributions Approval window. Select the record from the list and on the **Authorization** menu, Certify, Approve, and Authorize as shown below:

## Contribution Upload Template

To make contribution in batches, the membersâ€™ contributions are uploaded using a template which is generated and downloaded from the system. The teplate is populated with data and uploaded back for verification process before the posting of the contributions to members accounts.

The screenshot below shows how to navigate and download the template to the your computer. Click the **Contributions Upload Template** link to open the window through which a sponsor is picked as shown below:

**Tip**

- In the event of unagreeable data or tempered with template settings, the system will reject the upload through an error alert message in the troubleshooting window.
