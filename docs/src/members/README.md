### Introduction

The Members Module facilitates the seamless onboarding of individuals into a scheme by establishing a connection between members and their respective employers through Cost Centers. This linkage streamlines the management of diverse employers, members\' contributions, and overall operational processes. The module excels not only in ensuring efficient onboarding but also provides features for viewing existing members, uploading contributions, and initiating claim processes among others.

## Prerequisites

**Scheme Data Importation Guidelines**

To ensure an efficient upload of members' details, their beneficiaries, contributions, and opening balances into a new scheme setup in the system, scheme administrators should prepare templates with the following data:

1.  **Member Details Template:** Contains members' details with three unique columns: member number, member class code, and cost center code.

2.  **Beneficiary Details Template:** Contains beneficiaries' details with the member number column linking each beneficiary to a specific member.

3.  **Opening Balances Templates:**

    -   Consist of two templates - registered and unregistered opening balances.

    -   Each template has balances with a unique member number column, attaching the balances to specific members.

4.  **Member Contributions Template:**

    -   Includes members\' contributions and salary details.

    -   Contains a unique member number column that ties the contribution amounts to specific members.



### Upload Methods

There are two ways to upload member data into the system\'s member register:

1.  **Single Member Addition:**

    -   Fill in details in a member's details form for individual members.

    -   The added member must be approved via the Member Approval window to be officially saved in the member's register.


2.  **Batch Upload using Template File:**

    -   Utilize a template file (e.g., MS Excel) filled with member details.

    -   Upload the file into the system to add more than one member in a batch.
