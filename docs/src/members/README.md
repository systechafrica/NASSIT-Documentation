### Members Module

The Members Module simplifies the onboarding of individual contributing members into a scheme by establishing a connection between contributors and their respective establishments. This linkage enhances the management of multiple establishments, their members' contributions, and associated operational processes.

The module is designed to not only ensure efficient onboarding but also offers additional functionalities, including:

-   Viewing and managing existing members.
-   Uploading contributions.
-   Initiating and tracking claim processes.
-   Accessing other essential features for seamless operations.
