### Importing Members by Templates

To register members in batches, a template populated with data is uploaded into the system. To begin this process, click on the drop-down submenu link shown below to open the upload window as shown below:

<img  alt="new member link" width="98%" height="auto"  class="center"  src="../.vuepress/public/img/media3/newmember.png">

 
This method enables massive registration of members at a go. See a sample template used to import and upload members below:
