### Scheme Setup Module

The scheme setup module implements the trust deed and rules of a scheme. These rules are implemented in the system through configurations such as Basic Scheme Details, Contribution Rates, Benefits Configuration Matrix etc.

To access the Scheme Setup dashboard, click the '**Scheme Setup'** link on the landing page to open the '**Setup Links'** Window. Below is a screenshot of the Scheme Setup dashboard:
