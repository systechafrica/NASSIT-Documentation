## Profile Permissions

Once a profile is created, the next step is to allow access to certain sub-functions in the system to a newly created profile. The permissions given enable the new profile to access system modules and rights to certain functions in an
individual module.


Clicking the **Profile Permissions** link will open the profiles permission grid table where permissions are assigned to profiles. The table provides drop-down menus to choose profiles and the modules whose permissions are to be assigned to
a profile among others as shown below:

### Enabling Permissions

After clicking the **Filter** button, a grid table listing all **Permissions** in a selected Module will be displayed. Select Permission from the list and click the **Enable** button to activate the sub-functions in that Profile. Otherwise, click the **Disable** button to deactivate a Permission.
