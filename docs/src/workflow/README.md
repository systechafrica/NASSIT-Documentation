### Workflow Module

This workflow module enables a work distribution system that automates
all core processes such as claims, payroll processing, contribution, and
member registration. By assigning tasks to different users, the module
allows for step-by-step execution of tasks. This enables one to map
workflow processes, assign profile timelines, assign tasks, analyze
complete, overdue, and pending tasks, view task instances and assign
them to individuals or user profiles among other operations.
