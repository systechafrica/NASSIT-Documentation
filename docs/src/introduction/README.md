To access FundMaster on your device, launch your preferred internet browser and input the web Internet Protocol address provided by your system administrator as shown below:

After inputting the access IP address, a user is directed to the login page where one is supposed to enter login credentials for authentication.

**Note:** to successfully access the login page, the IP address must be correct and the local area connection stable. The following is a screenshot of the login page:
