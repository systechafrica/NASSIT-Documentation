## Chart of Accounts

A chart of Accounts (COA) is an index of all financial accounts set up in a scheme, and available for use by the bookkeeper for recording transactions in the general ledger.


## Creating a Chart of Accounts

For a new scheme, a new **Chart of Accounts** needs to be set from scratch as will be demonstrated next. Click the Chart of Accounts link from the General Ledger menu as shown in the previous screenshot.

On the right side of the screen, locate the **Initial Chart** menu and from the drop-down menu click **Create Default Chart** link as shown below:

<img  alt="Creating a Chart of Accounts" width="80%" height="auto"  class="center"  src="../.vuepress/public/img/media5/initialchart.jpg">

 
Clicking the **Create Default Chart** link will automatically generate the main types of accounts namely: Assets, Liabilities, Revenues, Expenses, and an additional Members Fund account - seeing this is a funds-related scheme. See the screenshot below: 

 <img  alt="Create Default Chart" width="90%" height="auto"  class="center"  src="../.vuepress/public/img/media5/defaultcharts.jpg"> 


### Creating a Single General ledger

After the default accounts are generated (labelled Heading in the charts), as shown previously, select an account category from the list (e.g., Expenses) to create a general ledger account as shown below:

<img  alt="Creating a Single General ledger" width="95%" height="auto"  class="center"  src="../.vuepress/public/img/media5/chartsofaccounts.jpg"> 


Clicking the **Single General Ledger** link will open a dialog box enabling the creation of a GL account for a particular category of expenses (e.g., Staff expenses) under the Expenses main account.  To achieve this, fill in the details (Make sure the Account Type, Account Name, and Categories are filled correctly) as shown in the screenshot below:

<img  alt="Creating a Single General ledger" width="70%" height="auto"  class="center"  src="../.vuepress/public/img/media5/accountdetails.jpg"> 


**Tips**

- After the default account categories are generated - labelled **Heading**. A bookkeeper can begin to build the chart of accounts (bookkeeping system) by creating different types of accounts under each category e.g., under the Expenses category, a Staff Expenses account can be created - labelled Heading. Within this GL account, entries - labelled **Posting** - can be created e.g., Staff Training, Goods Supplies, etc. as demonstrated next.

- In FundMaster, a chart of accounts builds a T-shape pattern in the Chart of Accounts window as more accounts and posting to the accounts are created.


## Journals

A journal is created to correct an account that was overstated or understated by debiting or and crediting the affected transactions accounts.

To access the journals records, on the left side panel of the accounts link window, click the **Journals** link as shown below:
