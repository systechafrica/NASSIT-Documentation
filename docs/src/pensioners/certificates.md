### Certificate of Existence Register 

First, a Certificate of Existence (C.O.E) is proof that a particular
pensioner is still alive. FundMaster has a provision for generating
C.O.E for different cycles with each cycle having the deadline at which
a pensioner must return the COE before the period elapsed. All COE
cycles are listed on the **'Certificate of Existence Register'** as
shown below:
