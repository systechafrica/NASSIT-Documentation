### Pensioners Module

The Pensioners Module enables the registration of pensioners through
templates into FundMaster. The Pensioners are connected to the members
register through member numbers. Furthermore, the module allows viewing
of pensioners\' registers at different status i.e., Active, Suspended,
Deferred. It enables onboarding of new pensioners, initiating death in
retirement process, running certificate of existence, running payroll,
adding deductions among other activities as will be demonstrated in this
chapter.
