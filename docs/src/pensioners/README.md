### Pensioners Module

The pensioners module contains information on scheme members that have
become eligible to receive their annuities/pension upon retirement. The
module allows for direct deductions from the annuity/pension to go into
other schemes like medical covers. Pensioners can add beneficiaries to
assume their annuities once they die. Depending on the status of the
pensioner, the annuity/pension can be suspended or reenabled from this
module. The panel also provides access to pension payroll processing
(for pensioners and beneficiaries), pension payroll reconciliation,
certificate of existence updating, pension liabilities processing, pay
points register administration, pension revisions, pension purchase and
commutations.
